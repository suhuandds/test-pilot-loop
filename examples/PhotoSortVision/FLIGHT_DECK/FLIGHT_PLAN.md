## AGENT OUTPUT LOG

### T001 — Import Screen

```
[2026-03-27 16:00] — Claude Code
Task ID: T001
Risk Level: 🟢 Low

Plan:
  • Build import screen with drag-and-drop zone and folder picker
  • Show photo count after folder selection
  • Add "Scan Now" CTA button

Output:
  Import screen complete. Drag-and-drop working, folder picker uses
  NSOpenPanel. Photo count updates live. "Scan Now" button triggers
  scan pipeline.

Files Modified:
  • PhotoSortVision/Views/ImportView.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Models/PhotoImporter.swift

Tests: Passed — unit tests for file counting, extension filtering

Confidence: 90%
Status: 🟢 Auto-Proceeding to T002
```

### T002 — PSV Engine Scan

```
[2026-03-27 16:30] — Claude Code
Task ID: T002
Risk Level: 🟡 Medium

Plan:
  • Build scan pipeline: pre-filter → text recognition → name card detection → grouping
  • Show progress with sub-stage indicators
  • Handle "previously sorted" detection

Output:
  Scan pipeline complete. Four-stage progress shown in real time.
  Pre-filter checks brightness/blur. Text recognition uses Vision framework.
  Name card detection matches patient names. Grouping assigns photos to patients.
  "Previously sorted" detection checks destination folder manifest.

Files Modified:
  • PhotoSortVision/Models/PSVEngine.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Models/TextRecognizer.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Models/NameCardDetector.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Views/ScanProgressView.swift

Tests: Passed — 12/12 unit tests, pipeline integration test with sample data

Confidence: 82%
  Unsure about edge case: what happens when brightness threshold is borderline.
  "Pre-filtered" stat label might be confusing (means "passed pre-filter" not
  "filtered out") — but this is a labeling concern, not a code issue.

Status: ⏳ Awaiting Review

Self-Assessment:
  The scan status line shows raw brightness values (e.g., "brightness=0.8").
  This is useful for debugging but might be too technical for end users.
  Flagging for reviewer to decide if this should be simplified.
```

### T003 — Review Screen

```
[2026-03-27 17:00] — Claude Code
Task ID: T003
Risk Level: 🟡 Medium

Plan:
  • Build master-detail layout: patient list (left), photo grid (right)
  • Add filter tabs: All, Assigned, Review, Excluded
  • Implement right-click context menu: Assign to, Exclude, Transform
  • Show status bar with counts

Output:
  Review screen complete. Patient list shows name, date, photo count,
  and assignment status. Photo grid loads thumbnails asynchronously.
  Context menu actions work. Filter tabs update both panels.

Files Modified:
  • PhotoSortVision/Views/ReviewView.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Views/PatientListRow.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Views/PhotoGridView.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Models/ReviewFilter.swift

Tests: Passed — 8/8 tests for filtering, assignment, exclusion

Confidence: 75%
  The context menu is only accessible via right-click. No visible affordance
  for trackpad users who may not know about two-finger tap. Flagging this
  as a potential usability concern.

Status: ⏳ Awaiting Review

Self-Assessment:
  Patient list row shows "/description" and "/subfolder" as template text.
  These fields come from the name card detection pipeline and may not always
  be populated. Need to decide: hide empty fields, or show placeholder?
  Made a design decision to show placeholder — may be wrong.
```

### T004 — Sort Execution

```
[2026-03-27 17:15] — Claude Code
Task ID: T004
Risk Level: 🔴 High

Plan:
  • Build sort confirmation screen with summary and backup warning
  • Implement file copy with progress and verification
  • Add undo support (reversible for 30 minutes)

Output:
  Sort execution complete. Files copied to patient folders with
  per-file verification (checksum). Undo stores manifest for rollback.
  Confirmation screen shows backup warning and "Back to Review" option.

Files Modified:
  • PhotoSortVision/Views/SortConfirmationView.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Views/SortProgressView.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Models/FileSorter.swift
  • PhotoSortVision/Models/UndoManager.swift

Tests: Passed — 6/6 tests including undo rollback test

Confidence: 85%
  File copy and verification work correctly. Undo tested.
  One concern: the "Sort Confirmed" button on the Review screen
  transitions to this view — event handler attachment timing
  might be an issue if the view isn't fully loaded when the
  button becomes tappable.

Status: ⏳ Awaiting Review

Self-Assessment:
  Stats on completion screen show "8 Skipped" but don't break down
  whether these are excluded by user or duplicates. The Sort Report
  has the full breakdown. Completion screen could be more detailed.
```

## FEEDBACK QUEUE

### From Test Pilot → Claude Code (2026-03-27 17:40)

```
Test Result: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS (24/30)

BUGS TO FIX (ordered by severity):

  1. BUG-001 [S3 🟡 Major] — "Sort Confirmed" requires double-click
     → FIX FIRST. First click produces no response. Second click works.
     → Likely event handler not attached on first render.
     → Root Cause: Event handler

  2. BUG-002 [S4 🔵 Minor] — "/description /subfolder" placeholder text visible
     → Fix after #1. Hide empty fields instead of showing template variables.
     → Root Cause: Missing validation

  3. BUG-003 [S4 🔵 Minor] — "Status" column header truncated to "St at us"
     → Column too narrow for header text. Widen or abbreviate.
     → Root Cause: Layout

  4. BUG-004 [S5 ⚪ Cosmetic] — "Avg: 0.0s / photo" rounding
     → Show 2 decimal places or omit if < 0.01s.
     → Root Cause: Missing validation

UX RECOMMENDATIONS (not bugs — for next iteration):
  • Disable "Sort New Only" when count is zero
  • Add subtitle to "92 To Review" explaining what it means
  • Add visible action affordance on photo thumbnails (not just right-click)
  • Simplify scan status line (hide brightness values)
  • Collapse PSV Engine settings under "Advanced" on first screen

HUMAN ESCALATION: None required for these bugs.
```

### From Test Pilot (Insider) → Claude Code (2026-03-27 18:15)

```
Test Result: ⚠️ NEEDS WORK (20/30)

Insider tier used real project specification: CLAUDE.md (538 lines) +
17 chapter specs (CH01–CH17). Findings are grounded in specific spec
requirements with chapter and rule references.

BUGS TO FIX (ordered by severity):

  1. BUG-I001 [S3 🟡 Major] — Duplicate patient entries from same-name series
     → FIX FIRST. "W-ng, Suet" appears twice in patient list (1 + 30 photos).
     → PhotoGrouper (CH05) doesn't merge series with identical names.
     → Root Cause: Missing deduplication in PhotoGrouper

  2. BUG-I002 [S3 🟡 Major] — "Schedule Import" section on Import screen is dead
     → Core feature (CH16, 467-line spec). Only accessible via Settings > Schedule.
     → Root Cause: Event handler not wired

  3. BUG-I003 [S3 🟡 Major] — Parenthetical preferred name not stripped
     → CH04 R4: "Remove parenthetical preferred names." "Sharick, Louise M (Lou"
       creates folder "Sharick_Louise_M_Lou" instead of "Sharick_Louise_M".
     → Root Cause: NameParser not implementing CH04 R4

  4. BUG-I004 [S4 🔵 Minor] — Context menu missing 2 of 5 spec'd actions
     → CH09 R4 requires: Assign to, Exclude, Transform, Set Description,
       Select All in Group. Last two are missing.
     → Root Cause: Incomplete implementation

  5. BUG-I005 [S4 🔵 Minor] — Cmd+Z undo stack not working
     → CH09 R6 specifies undo/redo stack. Cmd+Z does nothing after Exclude.
       No undo toast appears (CH09 R6 specifies toast with [Undo] link).
     → Root Cause: Undo stack not connected to review actions

  6. BUG-I006 [S4 🔵 Minor] — "X" keyboard shortcut doesn't exclude
     → CH09 R1/R10: "X Exclude selected photo(s)" — no response on keypress.
     → Root Cause: Keyboard shortcut not implemented

  7. BUG-I007–I011 [S4 🔵 Minor] — Five additional spec deviations:
     → No undo timer on Done screen (CH12 R5, 30-min window)
     → No confirmation after undo (silent transition to Review)
     → Undo uses modal dialog not inline expand (CH12 R5)
     → Missing "Review Photos" button on Import (CH16 R8)
     → Missing first-time cleanup modal (CH12 R2)

UX RECOMMENDATIONS (Insider-specific):
  • Merge same-name PatientSeries entries in PhotoGrouper
  • Implement NameParser parenthetical stripping per CH04 R4
  • Add "+ New Folder" and "Select Folder" buttons per CH09 R3
  • Add search/filter to "Assign to" submenu for large patient lists
  • Add Camera Time Correction section to Settings > Schedule (CH16 R9)

HUMAN ESCALATION: BUG-I001 (duplicate patients) may need architectural
  discussion — merging PatientSeries entries affects the data model.
```

## How This Example Demonstrates the Framework

This FLIGHT_PLAN shows one complete cycle of the Test Pilot Loop:

1. **Tasks assigned** with risk levels (T001–T005)
2. **Builder output** with confidence scores and self-assessment
3. **Test Pilot evaluation** as Cold User through computer use
4. **Insider tier evaluation** against the real 17-chapter product spec
5. **Bug reports** with severity, root cause, spec references, and reproduction steps
6. **Feedback queue** directing the fix cycle (Cold + Insider findings)
7. **Fix tasks created** (T006–T008) from Cold test findings

The builder flagged two of the four Cold bugs in self-assessment (placeholder text, event handler timing) but shipped anyway because tests passed. The Test Pilot caught them by actually using the app.

The Insider tier, armed with the real product specification, found 13 additional bugs that the Cold User could never have discovered — including data integrity issues (duplicate patients, wrong folder names from parenthetical nicknames) and 6 missing features specified in the chapters. This demonstrates why both tiers are essential: Cold catches UX confusion, Insider catches spec violations.
