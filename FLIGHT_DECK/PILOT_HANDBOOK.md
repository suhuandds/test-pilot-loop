# 📋 Pilot Handbook — Test Pilot Protocol v0.1.0
## Live, Persona-Based UX Testing Through Computer Use
**A framework where an AI agent tests software through computer use — clicking, typing, and navigating — with different personas, UX evaluation, accessibility checks, and instant feedback integrated into the build loop.**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

Traditional testing asks: **"Does the button work?"**
This protocol asks: **"Would a real person understand what to do, enjoy doing it, and succeed — even if they're not tech-savvy?"**

The AI Test Pilot (Cowork Opus) uses computer use to:
- Launch and interact with the **live running app** (not mockups, not screenshots)
- Inhabit **different user personas** with varying tech literacy, patience, and expectations
- Evaluate **functionality, usability, visual design, accessibility, and user journey flow**
- Produce **structured feedback** that maps directly to actionable fixes
- Feed results **back into the build loop** for immediate iteration

---

## 📋 PREREQUISITES — What the Test Pilot Needs

Before any test session, the Test Pilot must have:

### 1. Project Understanding
- **PRD.md** — what the app is supposed to do (product requirements)
- **Target user profiles** — who will use this software
- **Success criteria** — what "working correctly" looks like
- **Platform context** — iOS simulator? macOS app? Web browser? Remote desktop?

### 2. App Access
- Running instance of the app (simulator, localhost, deployed build)
- Cowork folder mounts to project directory
- Screenshot save location (`AUDIT_SCREENSHOTS/`)

### 3. Test Scope (from orchestration file)
- Which task(s) just completed
- What feature was built or changed
- What files were modified
- Agent's self-assessment and confidence score

---

## 👥 USER PERSONAS — The Test Pilot's Identities

The Test Pilot doesn't test as "an AI." It tests as **specific human personas** with defined psychological profiles, behavioral constraints, and predictable reactions. The specificity of these behaviors is what makes the testing produce different results per persona — not just different labels.

> **📁 Canonical source:** The full persona definitions live in `PERSONAS/agents/`. Those files are the source of truth. This section is a summary.

### Core 4 Personas (Use for Every Project)

| Persona | File | Mindset | Key Behavior | Tests For |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 🟢 **Alex** (Power User) | `test-pilot-alex.md` | "Don't slow me down." | Skips all tutorials, hunts for Cmd+shortcuts, tries bulk ops, rage-taps if slow | Efficiency, missing shortcuts, workflow friction |
| 🟡 **Jordan** (Everyday User) | `test-pilot-jordan.md` | "I just want to do the thing." | Follows the biggest button, reads labels not paragraphs, expects feedback after every tap | Confusing labels, broken happy path, missing feedback |
| 🔴 **Pat** (Struggling User) | `test-pilot-pat.md` | "I'm going to break it." | Reads EVERYTHING, afraid of "Execute" button, panics at red text, gives up after 3 confusing steps | Cognitive overload, scary jargon, missing undo, small targets |
| ♿ **Sam** (Accessibility User) | `test-pilot-sam.md` | "Software must adapt to me." | Navigates ONLY by Tab/Enter, checks contrast ratios, focus indicators, screen reader order, touch targets | WCAG compliance, keyboard traps, low contrast, missing alt-text |

### Knowledge Tiers (Use for UX Phase Testing)

| Tier | File | What They Know | What They Test |
|------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 🔴 **Tier 1** (Cold User) | `test-pilot-tier1-cold.md` | App name ONLY | Discoverability, first impressions, learnability |
| 🟡 **Tier 2** (Guided User) | `test-pilot-tier2-guided.md` | User manual only | Documentation accuracy, instruction followability. **⚠️ Only deploy when a user guide/manual/handbook exists.** |
| 🟢 **Tier 3** (Insider) | `test-pilot-tier3-insider.md` | Full PRD | Spec compliance, feature completeness, acceptance criteria, **exhaustive element audit — every button/toggle/preview in the spec must be clicked and verified** |

### What Each Tier Uniquely Does (That the Others Can't)

| Tier | Unique Contribution | Why Only This Tier |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Cold** | First impressions and discoverability — can a stranger figure it out? | The Insider already knows the app. The Guided user has the manual. Only the Cold user is truly lost. |
| **Guided** | Manual accuracy cross-check — does the documentation match reality? | Only the Guided user reads the manual and compares it to what's on screen. Manual says "click the green button on the top right" but it's actually a blue button on the bottom left — only Guided catches this. |
| **Insider** | Exhaustive spec compliance — is every function built and working? | Only the Insider has the full spec and can verify every button, toggle, and expected outcome against it. Catches all functional bugs the other tiers would also find, plus spec gaps they'd miss entirely. |

### Insider Pre-Flight: Read Everything, Test Everything

The Insider performs the most extensive test possible. Before testing any screen, the Insider **must**:

1. **Read the full spec** — `CLAUDE.md`, `PRD.md`, and any referenced spec files. This gives complete knowledge of every screen, every button, every toggle, every state transition, and every expected outcome.
2. **Build a complete element checklist per screen** — extract every interactive element from the spec section for that screen: buttons, toggles, dropdowns, text fields, sliders, drag targets, context menus, keyboard shortcuts, live previews, cards, badges, links, state transitions.
3. **Test every element** — click/activate each one, verify it does what the spec says, check dependent UI updates, verify state transitions between screens.
4. **Track coverage** — report how many spec elements were tested vs. how many exist. Every skipped element must be reported with a reason.

This is not a suggestion — it's the Insider's core job. Without it, bugs ship. See `test-pilot-tier3-insider.md` for the full protocol.

### Deployment Logic

**Always deploy Insider** — it catches all functional bugs through exhaustive element testing. This is the minimum for any test flight.

**Add Cold** when you want UX and design feedback — first impressions, discoverability, layout opinions. Useful for consumer apps or when you want a fresh perspective on the UI.

**Add Guided** only when a user guide/manual/handbook exists and you want its accuracy verified. No manual = no Guided. It has nothing to test against.

See `PREFLIGHT_CHECK.md` for specific preset configurations.

### Universal Archetypes (Layer on Top of Personas)

| Archetype | File | When to Apply | Focus |
|-----------|------|--------------|-------|
| **Creator** | `archetype-overlays.md` | Data entry, import, forms, uploads | Flow state, data safety, validation |
| **Administrator** | `archetype-overlays.md` | Settings, config, permissions, exports | Control, visibility, bulk management |
| **Consumer** | `archetype-overlays.md` | Viewing results, browsing, dashboards | Zero friction, visual polish, instant value |

**How to combine:** Personas describe WHO (skill level). Archetypes describe WHAT (task type). Knowledge tiers describe HOW MUCH they know. Combine all three for the richest testing:
- "Pat (Struggling User) as Creator (importing photos) at Tier 1 (knows nothing)"

### Two Types of Findings — Route Them Differently

| Type | Source | Example | Route to |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Bug** (broken function) | Insider element audit, any tier | "Live preview doesn't update," "button does nothing on click" | Claude Code → fix it |
| **Design feedback** (UX opinion) | Cold, Guided, Personas | "Layout feels cramped," "font too small for office monitor," "expected button on the right" | Human director → decide whether to act |

The Insider finds all bugs. Other tiers and personas provide design and UX commentary — subjective observations about layout, visual hierarchy, wording, and feel. These are not defects; they are design inputs. Tag them as `UX FEEDBACK` (not `BUG`) so they follow the UX feedback pipeline (see `FLIGHT_DEBRIEF.md` → UX Feedback Pipeline), not the bug-fix loop.

**UX feedback flow:** Collected during testing → logged but NOT acted on during bug-fix loop → after all bugs verified, Cowork groups by screen, evaluates, and presents to human director → human approves/rejects/defers → approved items become tasks in the next cycle.

### Domain-Specific Personas (Add Your Own)

Create additional `.claude/agents/test-pilot-[name].md` files for your domain. See `PERSONAS/README.md` for the template.

**Examples:** Busy Clinician, Teen User, IT Admin, First-Time Buyer — see persona files for format.

## 🔄 TEST SESSION WORKFLOW

> **For the step-by-step execution protocol** — how to inspect each screen, inventory elements, form predictions, and evaluate actions — see [TEST_FLIGHT_PROTOCOL.md](TEST_FLIGHT_PROTOCOL.md). This section covers the persona rotation and session structure; the protocol covers the screen-by-screen testing cycle (SEE→INVENTORY→PREDICT→ACT→EVALUATE).

### How to Run Persona-Based Testing

> **Canonical mode (default):** Cowork Opus drives the app through computer use and adopts each persona's behavioral rules in sequential passes. **Persona subagents are an optional helper pattern** — they run in Claude Code for code-side evaluation and report generation, not for direct UI interaction.

**Option A: Cowork Opus sequential rotation (default — recommended)**
Opus adopts each persona sequentially, re-reading the persona's behavioral rules before each run. One agent drives the UI through computer use for all passes.
```
Test [feature] sequentially with each persona:
  Run 1: @test-pilot-alex — test as Power User → capture report
  Run 2: @test-pilot-jordan — test as Everyday User → capture report
  Run 3: @test-pilot-pat — test as Struggling User → capture report
  Run 4: @test-pilot-sam — test as Accessibility User → capture report
  
Reset the app to the same starting state before each run.
Each persona reports independently. Compare results after all 4 complete.
```

**Option B: Sequential rotation (Cowork Opus tests as each persona in turn)**
Opus adopts each persona sequentially, re-reading the persona's behavioral rules before each run. Use when computer use requires a single agent operating the UI.

**Option C: Agent Teams (for deep collaborative testing)**
```
Create a test pilot team. Spawn 4 teammates:
  "alex" with prompt from test-pilot-alex.md
  "jordan" with prompt from test-pilot-jordan.md
  "pat" with prompt from test-pilot-pat.md
  "sam" with prompt from test-pilot-sam.md
Have them test [feature] and share findings with each other.
```

### For Each Completed Task (🟡 Medium / 🔴 High Risk):

```
PHASE 1: CONTEXT LOADING (2 min)
  • Read PRD.md — understand what the app should do
  • Read the completed task from AGENT OUTPUT LOG — what was built
  • Read the agent's confidence score and self-assessment
  • Select archetype overlay based on feature type:
    - Data entry / import / form → Creator archetype
    - Settings / config / management → Admin archetype
    - Viewing / browsing / results → Consumer archetype

PHASE 2: FUNCTIONAL TEST (3-5 min)
  • Launch the app via computer use
  • Spawn @test-pilot-alex (or test as Alex persona): core functionality
  • Verify: does it do what the task said it should do?
  • Try happy path, then deliberately try to break it
  • Score Dimension 1 (Functional) and Dimension 6 (Edge Cases)

PHASE 3: PERSONA ROTATION (5-10 min)
  • Spawn @test-pilot-jordan (or switch to Jordan persona)
    - Try to use the feature without any prior knowledge
    - Note where Jordan pauses, hesitates, or feels unsure
    - Score Dimension 2 (Usability)

  • Spawn @test-pilot-pat (or switch to Pat persona)
    - Approach the feature as Pat — afraid to break things
    - Read every label. Try the most obvious-looking action first.
    - Note anything confusing, scary, or unclear
    - Score Dimension 2 (Usability) from Pat's perspective

  • Spawn @test-pilot-sam (or switch to Sam persona)
    - Navigate ONLY with keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape)
    - Check contrast, touch targets, dynamic type, focus indicators
    - Score Dimension 4 (Accessibility)

PHASE 4: VISUAL & LAYOUT REVIEW (2-3 min)
  • Take a step back — look at the screen holistically
  • Check alignment, spacing, typography, color usage
  • Compare to other screens in the app — is it consistent?
  • Score Dimension 3 (Visual Design)

PHASE 5: USER JOURNEY TEST (3-5 min)
  • As "Everyday User": complete the full workflow from entry to goal
  • Note any dead ends, unclear next steps, missing confirmation
  • Score Dimension 5 (User Journey)

PHASE 6: REPORT (3 min)
  • Write the Test Pilot Report (see template below)
  • Save screenshots for anything notable
  • Write verdict: PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL
```

## 📊 SCORING THRESHOLDS

| Overall Score | Verdict | Action |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| 25-30 | ✅ PASS | Approve task. Proceed to next. |
| 20-24 | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS | Approve with caveats. Log issues for later fix. |
| 15-19 | ❌ SOFT FAIL | Send back to build agent with specific fixes. Retest after. |
| Below 15 | ❌ HARD FAIL | Escalate to Opus brain for architectural review. Something is fundamentally wrong. |

**Override rules:**
- ANY 🔴 Critical issue = automatic FAIL regardless of score
- Accessibility score of 1 or 2 = automatic FAIL (not shipping inaccessible software)
- User Journey score of 1 = automatic FAIL (users can't complete the basic flow)

---

## 🔁 RETEST PROTOCOL

When a task fails and is sent back for fixes:

1. Build agent fixes the specific issues listed in the Test Pilot Report
2. Build agent sets status → `⏳ Awaiting Review`
3. Test Pilot runs an **abbreviated retest** — only the failed dimensions:
   - Verify each reported issue is fixed
   - Re-score only the dimensions that failed
   - Check that fixes didn't break other dimensions (regression)
4. If all issues resolved → ✅ PASS
5. If new issues introduced → ❌ FAIL with new report

**Maximum retest cycles:** 3. If a feature fails 3 times, escalate to Opus brain for redesign.

---

## ⚡ QUICK TEST vs. FULL TEST

Not every task needs a full 6-dimension persona rotation.

| Task Risk Level | Test Type | Duration | Personas | Dimensions |
|----------------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| ⚪ Trivial | No test | 0 min | None | Opus patrol fast-approve only |
| 🟢 Low | Quick Test | 2-3 min | Expert only | Functional + Edge Cases |
| 🟡 Medium | Standard Test | 10-15 min | Expert + Everyday + Accessibility | All 6 dimensions |
| 🔴 High | Full Test | 15-25 min | All 4+ domain persona | All 6 dimensions + regression |
| 🏁 Milestone | Comprehensive Test | 30+ min | All personas, full journey, all screens | Full regression suite |

## 🎯 REAL HUMAN TESTER AGENDA — What They Focus On

For reference, here is what a professional human QA tester's agenda looks like for a typical test session. The AI Test Pilot should match this level of rigor:

**Pre-Session (5 min):**
- Review what was changed and why
- Understand the expected user flow
- Identify risk areas based on complexity of changes

**Core Testing (20-30 min):**
1. **Smoke test** — does the app launch, does the main feature work at all?
2. **Happy path** — follow the intended user flow start to finish
3. **Negative testing** — enter wrong data, skip steps, go backward
4. **Boundary testing** — minimum/maximum values, empty states, long inputs
5. **Regression check** — did fixing one thing break something else?
6. **Visual inspection** — alignment, spacing, consistency with existing screens
7. **Accessibility quick-check** — contrast, font scaling, touch targets

**Post-Session (5-10 min):**
- Prioritize findings: critical → major → minor → cosmetic
- Write clear reproduction steps for each bug
- Suggest fixes when the solution is obvious
- Flag anything that needs design input vs. just code fixes

**What separates good from great testers:**
- They test the **transitions** (what happens between screens, during loading, after errors)
- They test with **real-world data** (not just "test123" — use realistic, domain-appropriate data that reflects real workflows)
- They test **interruptions** (phone call mid-flow, app backgrounded, low battery warning)
- They notice **inconsistency** (this screen uses "Cancel" but that screen uses "Back")
- They think about **first impressions** (what does a brand-new user see?)

---

## 🔮 FUTURE EXTENSIONS

### Multi-Device Testing
Test the same feature on multiple device sizes/orientations in sequence.

### Competitive Benchmarking
Compare UX against competitor apps: "Is our onboarding faster than CompetitorApp's?"

### Longitudinal Testing
Track dimension scores over time. Is UX improving or degrading with each release?

### A/B Layout Testing
Test two versions of a screen with different personas and compare scores.

### Automated Regression Suite
Build a library of persona-based test scenarios that run after every significant change.
