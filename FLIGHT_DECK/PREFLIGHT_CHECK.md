# ✅ Preflight Check — Test Pilot Configuration
## Customize Your Testing — Everything Is Adjustable
**Lives at `FLIGHT_DECK/PREFLIGHT_CHECK.md` in your project. The Test Pilot reads it before every session.**

---

## 🎯 Why This File Exists

The Test Pilot Loop framework defaults to maximum rigor: 4 personas, 3 knowledge tiers, 6 dimensions, full scoring. That's thorough — but it's also expensive and time-consuming.

**Not every project needs maximum rigor.**

A weekend side project needs a quick sanity check, not a 7-persona deep dive. A medical device app needs the full suite plus domain personas. This file lets you dial the testing up or down based on what your project actually needs.

**Everything below is optional. If this file doesn't exist, the framework uses defaults.**

## 👥 PERSONA SELECTION

Choose which personas to deploy. Minimum: 1. Recommended: 2-4.

```
ACTIVE PERSONAS:
  ✅ Alex (Power User)          — deploy: YES / NO
  ✅ Jordan (Everyday User)     — deploy: YES / NO
  ✅ Pat (Struggling User)      — deploy: YES / NO
  ✅ Sam (Accessibility User)   — deploy: YES / NO
```

### Presets

**Quick Test (1 persona — fastest, cheapest)**
Best for: ⚪ Trivial and 🟢 Low risk tasks, rapid iteration, early prototyping
```
  ✅ Jordan (Everyday User)
  ❌ Alex, Pat, Sam — skipped
```
Why Jordan: catches the most common issues for the broadest user base.

**Standard Test (2 personas — good balance)**
Best for: 🟡 Medium risk tasks, most development work
```
  ✅ Jordan (Everyday User)
  ✅ Pat (Struggling User)
  ❌ Alex, Sam — skipped
```
Why these two: Jordan finds mainstream confusion, Pat finds cognitive overload. Together they cover ~90% of real user problems.

**Full Test (4 personas — maximum coverage)**
Best for: 🔴 High risk tasks, milestone reviews, pre-release
```
  ✅ Alex (Power User)
  ✅ Jordan (Everyday User)
  ✅ Pat (Struggling User)
  ✅ Sam (Accessibility User)
```

**Accessibility-First (2 personas — compliance focus)**
Best for: apps with legal accessibility requirements, healthcare, government
```
  ✅ Sam (Accessibility User)
  ✅ Pat (Struggling User)
  ❌ Alex, Jordan — skipped
```

### Custom Personas

Add your own domain personas. Set deploy to YES/NO per session.

```
CUSTOM PERSONAS:
  ⬜ [Name] ([Role])            — deploy: YES / NO
     Subagent file: .claude/agents/test-pilot-[name].md
  ⬜ [Name] ([Role])            — deploy: YES / NO
     Subagent file: .claude/agents/test-pilot-[name].md
```

---

## 🧠 KNOWLEDGE TIER SELECTION

Choose which knowledge tiers to deploy for UX testing. Minimum: 1. Recommended: 2-3.

```
ACTIVE TIERS:
  ✅ Tier 1 — Cold User (knows nothing)     — deploy: YES / NO
  ✅ Tier 2 — Guided User (has manual)       — deploy: YES / NO   ⚠️ REQUIRES user guide/manual/handbook
  ✅ Tier 3 — Insider (has PRD)              — deploy: YES / NO
```

**Deployment prerequisite:** Tier 2 (Guided) requires a user guide, manual, handbook, or help documentation to exist. If there is no documentation to test against, do NOT deploy Guided — it has nothing to work with. Skip it and use Cold + Insider instead.

### Deployment Logic

Each tier does one thing the others can't:

- **Insider** — exhaustive spec compliance. Tests every function, every button, every expected outcome. Catches all bugs. **Always deploy.**
- **Cold** — first impressions and discoverability. Can a stranger figure it out? **Add when you want UX/design feedback.**
- **Guided** — manual accuracy cross-check. Does the documentation match reality? **Add only when a manual exists.**

### Presets

**Quick UX Check (1 tier)**
```
  ✅ Tier 1 — Cold User only
```
Why: if a cold user can complete the task, UX is good enough. Fastest signal.

**Standard UX Test (2 tiers)**
```
  ✅ Tier 1 — Cold User
  ✅ Tier 3 — Insider
```
Why: the gap between these two IS the Tier Gap Ratio. Skipping Tier 2 saves time while still measuring the knowledge gap.

**Insider Only — Exhaustive Spec Audit (1 tier)**
```
  ❌ Tier 1 — Cold User — skipped
  ❌ Tier 2 — Guided User — skipped
  ✅ Tier 3 — Insider (exhaustive element audit)
```
Why: the Insider tests every function, every button, every expected outcome against the spec. Catches all functional bugs, spec deviations, and missing features. Other tiers only add UX perspective (first impressions, documentation accuracy) — they don't find bugs the Insider wouldn't. Best for: professional/trained-user apps where users know the workflow (e.g., dental practice software, internal tools, B2B apps). Skips discoverability testing since your users will be trained.

**What you trade away:** Cold tier first-impression testing (would a stranger figure this out?) and Guided tier documentation testing (does the manual match reality?). For consumer apps, those matter. For professional tools with trained users, they're noise.

**Optional: Layer UX tiers for design feedback.** Even with Insider-only for bug finding, you can add Cold or Guided tiers occasionally for *design commentary* — layout, visual hierarchy, font size, button placement, color choices. These are not bug reports; they are design inputs for the human director and Cowork to evaluate. Route them separately: bugs go to Claude Code for fixing, design feedback goes to the human for a decision.

**Full UX Test (3 tiers)**
```
  ✅ Tier 1 — Cold User
  ✅ Tier 2 — Guided User
  ✅ Tier 3 — Insider
```
Why: also tests documentation quality (Tier 2). Use for pre-release.

## 🔍 DIMENSION SELECTION

Choose which of the 6 test dimensions to evaluate. Minimum: 1. Recommended: 3-6.

```
ACTIVE DIMENSIONS:
  ✅ ⚙️ Functional Correctness    — evaluate: YES / NO
  ✅ 🧭 Usability & Clarity        — evaluate: YES / NO
  ✅ 🎨 Visual Design & Layout     — evaluate: YES / NO

  ✅ 🗺️ User Journey Completion    — evaluate: YES / NO
  ✅ 🔨 Edge Case Resilience       — evaluate: YES / NO
```

### Presets

**UX Focus (3 dimensions)**
```
  ✅ 🧭 Usability & Clarity
  ✅ 🗺️ User Journey Completion
  ✅ 🔨 Edge Case Resilience
```
Use for: UX-heavy features, onboarding flows, forms.

**Visual Focus (2 dimensions)**
```
  ✅ 🎨 Visual Design & Layout
  ✅ ♿ Accessibility
```

## 📊 SCORING THRESHOLDS

Adjust pass/fail criteria based on your project's quality bar.

```
PASS THRESHOLDS:
  ✅ PASS score:              [25] / 30    (default: 25)
  ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS score:  [20] / 30    (default: 20)
  ❌ SOFT FAIL score:         [15] / 30    (default: 15 — send back for fixes)
  ❌ HARD FAIL score:         below [15]    (default: below 15 — escalate to brain)
```

```
UX QUALITY GATES:
  ⭐ Excellent: Tier Gap Ratio ≤ [1.5]x    (default: 1.5)
  🟢 Good:     Tier Gap Ratio ≤ [2.0]x     (default: 2.0)
  🟡 Acceptable: Tier Gap Ratio ≤ [3.0]x   (default: 3.0)
  🔴 Fail:     Tier 1 cannot complete        (always applies)
```

```
AUTO-FAIL OVERRIDES (always applies regardless of score):
  ✅ Any 🔴 Critical bug = automatic FAIL         — override: YES / NO
  ✅ Accessibility score 1-2 = automatic FAIL      — override: YES / NO
  ✅ User Journey score 1 = automatic FAIL          — override: YES / NO
```

## 🏢 ARCHETYPE OVERLAY

Choose which archetype to apply based on what you're testing. Set per feature or per session.

```
DEFAULT ARCHETYPE: [Creator / Admin / Consumer / Auto]
```

**Auto mode:** The Test Pilot selects the archetype based on the feature:
- Data entry / import / form features → Creator
- Settings / config / management → Admin
- Viewing / browsing / results → Consumer

---

## ⏱️ TESTING DEPTH PER RISK LEVEL

Customize how much testing each risk level gets.

```
RISK LEVEL TESTING:

⚪ Trivial:
  Personas: [0]  (default: 0 — Opus patrol fast-approve)
  Tiers: [0]
  Dimensions: [0]

🟢 Low:
  Personas: [1]  (default: 1 — Jordan only)
  Tiers: [0]     (default: 0 — no UX tier testing)

🟡 Medium:
  Personas: [2-3] (default: Jordan + Pat + optionally Sam)
  Tiers: [2]      (default: Tier 1 + Tier 3)
  Dimensions: [6] (default: all)

🔴 High:
  Personas: [4+]  (default: all 4 + domain personas)
  Tiers: [3]      (default: all 3 tiers)
  Dimensions: [6] (default: all)

🏁 Milestone:
  Personas: [4+]  (default: all + domain)
  Tiers: [3]      (default: all 3)
  Dimensions: [6] (default: all)
  Additional: Full regression + user journey end-to-end
```

---

## 🔄 RETEST CONFIGURATION

```
Max retest cycles before escalation: [3]    (default: 3)
Retest scope: [failed dimensions only / full retest]  (default: failed only)
```

---

## 🧠 MODEL SELECTION FOR TESTING

```
Orchestrator / Test Pilot:  Opus          (always — this is Cowork Opus)
Persona subagents:          [sonnet / opus]    (default: sonnet)
Upgrade subagents to Opus:  [🔴 High risk only / 🟡+ / always]  (default: 🔴 only)
```

---

## 📝 EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS

### Weekend Side Project
```
Personas: Jordan only
Tiers: Tier 1 only
Dimensions: Functional + Usability
Pass threshold: 15/30
Persona model: sonnet
```
Total testing time per feature: ~5 minutes

### Production SaaS App
```
Personas: Jordan + Pat + Sam
Tiers: Tier 1 + Tier 3
Dimensions: All 6
Pass threshold: 22/30
Persona model: sonnet (opus for 🔴 High risk)
```
Total testing time per feature: ~20 minutes

### Regulated Industry (Healthcare, Finance, etc.)
```
Personas: All 4 + domain expert persona
Tiers: All 3
Dimensions: All 6
Pass threshold: 25/30
Auto-fail on any accessibility issue: YES
Persona model: opus for all personas
Human approval required for: ALL features
```
Total testing time per feature: ~35 minutes

### Professional / Trained-User App (e.g., PhotoSortVision)
```
Personas: None (Insider covers functional testing exhaustively)
Tiers: Tier 3 — Insider only (exhaustive element audit)
Dimensions: All 6
Pass threshold: 25/30
Auto-fail on any broken element: YES
Persona model: opus (Insider needs full reasoning for spec comparison)
```
Total testing time per feature: ~15-25 minutes
Why this works: users are trained professionals who know the workflow. The Insider tests every button, toggle, live preview, and keyboard shortcut against the spec. No need for Cold tier "can a stranger figure this out?" testing — your users aren't strangers. Catches all functional bugs that other tiers would also find, plus spec compliance bugs that only the Insider can find.

### MVP / Prototype (Just Ship It)
```
Personas: Jordan only
Tiers: None
Dimensions: Functional only
Pass threshold: 10/30
Model: sonnet
```
Total testing time per feature: ~3 minutes
