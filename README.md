# 🧪 Test Pilot Loop

### AI that doesn't just write code — it flies the product first.

> *A framework where AI agents test software by using it — as different people, with different knowledge, measuring real UX.*

**Status: Experimental (v0.1.0) — Seeking real-world validation.**

> This is a docs-first framework: methodology, templates, and prompt assets — not a packaged software library. Copy the runtime files into your project repo to use the loop. See [What to Copy](#what-to-copy) below.

## The Problem

Your code agent writes beautiful code. Tests pass. CI is green. Then a real user opens the app:

> *"I don't know what this button does."*
> *"Where did my data go?"*
> *"How do I get back?"*

Code tests verify that functions return the right values. Nobody verifies that a human can actually use the result.

**The Test Pilot Loop fixes this.** After code is built, an AI uses the app through computer use — actually tapping, scrolling, typing, navigating — and gives honest human feedback. Not just bugs. Confusion, frustration, and friction.

**The app isn't done when code passes. It's done when the Test Pilot can use it.**

## How It Works

```
🛠️ Coding Agent builds feature
         ↓
✈️ Cowork (Test Pilot / Orchestrator)
         ↓
🧪 3-Tier Test Flight (Cold → Guided → Insider)
         ↓
📋 Flight Debrief (Unified + Prioritized)
         ↓
🛠️ Coding Agent implements fixes
         ↓
🔄 Verification Flight (Cowork retests)
         ↓
📈 Gap Check + Pass/Fail Decision
         ↓
🚀 Next cycle (if needed) — or ✅ Ship it
```

**The gap between the Cold user and the Insider is a quantitative measure of your UX quality.** We call it the **Tier Gap Ratio**: Cold user steps ÷ Insider steps. When it's 3x, your app depends on prior knowledge. When it's 1.5x, your app is genuinely intuitive.

## Three Levels of Use

### 🛫 Quick Flight — Zero Setup, 5 Minutes

Three Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) each test your app independently. Each model's cognitive style naturally creates a different perspective:

- **Opus** overthinks — catches design flaws and subtle UX problems
- **Sonnet** follows the flow — catches what a normal user hits
- **Haiku** skims — catches what someone who gives up in 10 seconds would miss

No persona files. No configuration. Just three models, three honest reports.

### 🧪 Test Pilot Loop — Continuous Build-Test-Fix Cycle

Cowork Opus stays open as the brain. After each build, it test-drives the app three times — each time constrained to a different knowledge level. Writes structured feedback to a shared file. Code agent reads it, fixes, signals "ready for retest." Opus retests. Loop until it passes.

**One session. No switching. Continuous feedback loop.**

> **Canonical mode:** One Cowork Opus orchestrator drives the app through computer use and runs all evaluation passes sequentially. Persona subagent files (in `PERSONAS/`) are an optional helper pattern for code-side evaluation — the orchestrator is the default.

- **Personas** model **who** the tester is (expert, everyday, struggling, accessibility)
- **Knowledge tiers** model **what** the tester knows (nothing, user manual, full PRD)

The combination answers: can THIS person, with THIS much knowledge, use the app?

## What to Copy

This repo contains both **reference docs** (explaining the methodology) and **runtime files** (to copy into your project). Here's what goes where:

| Copy This | Into Your Project | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project root | Claude Code entrypoint (imports AUTOPILOT.md) |
| `FLIGHT_DECK/AUTOPILOT.md` | `FLIGHT_DECK/AUTOPILOT.md` | Builder agent instructions |
| `FLIGHT_DECK/FLIGHT_PLAN.md` | `FLIGHT_DECK/FLIGHT_PLAN.md` | Shared communication hub (edit per project) |
| `FLIGHT_DECK/PREFLIGHT_CHECK.md` | `FLIGHT_DECK/PREFLIGHT_CHECK.md` | Test configuration (edit per project) |
| `PERSONAS/agents/*.md` | `.claude/agents/` | Persona subagent files |
| `PRD.md` (you write this) | Project root | Your product requirements |

The remaining files (`TEST_PILOT_LOOP.md`, `QUICK_FLIGHT.md`, `PILOT_HANDBOOK.md`, `FLIGHT_DEBRIEF.md`, `FLIGHT_LOG.md`, `TEST_FLIGHT_PROTOCOL.md`, `OPENCLAW_SKILL.md`) are reference docs — read them to understand the framework, but they don't need to live in your project.

## Persona Subagents

Ready-to-use Claude Code subagent files. Drop into `.claude/agents/` and spawn them by name.

**Core 4 Personas:**

| File | Persona | Tests For |
|------|---------|-----------|
| [test-pilot-alex.md](PERSONAS/agents/test-pilot-alex.md) | 🟢 Power User | Shortcuts, batch ops, efficiency |
| [test-pilot-jordan.md](PERSONAS/agents/test-pilot-jordan.md) | 🟡 Everyday User | Confusing labels, broken happy path |
| [test-pilot-pat.md](PERSONAS/agents/test-pilot-pat.md) | 🔴 Struggling User | Cognitive overload, scary jargon |
| [test-pilot-sam.md](PERSONAS/agents/test-pilot-sam.md) | ♿ Accessibility User | WCAG compliance, keyboard traps |

**Knowledge Tiers:**

| File | Tier | Knowledge |
|------|------|-----------|
| [test-pilot-tier1-cold.md](PERSONAS/agents/test-pilot-tier1-cold.md) | Cold | Knows nothing |
| [test-pilot-tier2-guided.md](PERSONAS/agents/test-pilot-tier2-guided.md) | Guided | Has user manual |
| [test-pilot-tier3-insider.md](PERSONAS/agents/test-pilot-tier3-insider.md) | Insider | Has full PRD |

**Archetype Overlays:** [Creator / Admin / Consumer](PERSONAS/archetypes/archetype-overlays.md) — layer on top of any persona based on what feature is being tested.

**→ [Persona docs: PERSONAS/](PERSONAS/)**

## Requirements

This framework requires **Claude with computer use capability:**

- **Cowork (Claude Desktop app)** with computer use enabled — for the Test Pilot to see and interact with your app
- **Claude Code** — for building features and running subagents
- **A running instance of your app** visible on screen:

| Project Type | How to Launch for Testing |
|---|---|
| macOS app | Build and run in Xcode — app window visible on desktop |
| iOS app | Run in Xcode Simulator — simulator window visible on screen |
| Web app | Start dev server, open `localhost` in browser |
| Website | Open the URL in Safari or Chrome |
| Android app | Run in Android Studio emulator |
| CLI tool | Open Terminal, ready for commands |

**Key:** The app must be on the **same Mac** where Cowork is running and **visible on screen** (not minimized). Cowork interacts with what it can see.

The Test Pilot Loop is not a fully automated plug-and-play system (yet). It's a governed framework that requires a human director to launch the app, set up sessions, and make final calls. The AI handles the testing; you handle the setup.

> **Note:** The methodology is agent-agnostic. This repo is a reference implementation using Claude Code + Cowork. The concepts (persona-based testing, knowledge tiers, structured feedback loops) can be adapted to other AI agents with computer use capabilities.

## The Adoption Path

```
🛫 Quick Flight          "Let me try this in 5 minutes"
         ↓                     
🧪 Test Pilot Loop       "This works. I want continuous testing."
         ↓                     
📋 Personas               "I want deeper behavioral testing."
         ↓                     
🏗️ Flight Deck            "I need full governance for my team."
```

Start wherever makes sense for your project. Each layer is compatible with the ones above and below it.

## What Makes This Different

| What exists today | What Test Pilot Loop adds |
|---|---|
| Unit tests check code correctness | **Test Pilot checks if a human can use it** |
| Linters check style | **Test Pilot checks if labels make sense** |
| CI validates that code compiles | **Test Pilot validates that users can succeed** |
| Code review checks implementation | **Test Pilot checks experience** |
| QA testers know the product | **Cold User knows nothing — tests real discoverability** |

This repo combines: live app testing through computer use + persona-based behavioral evaluation + knowledge-tiered UX measurement + structured feedback loops back to the coding agent.

---

## Origin

This framework was created by a developer who got tired of shipping features that passed every test but confused every user.

The core insight: **the person who builds the software is the worst person to test it.** They know too much. They can't see what's confusing because nothing confuses them.

So we built an AI test pilot that can forget what it knows and fly the product as someone who doesn't.

---

## Safety and Privacy

This framework uses **computer use** — the AI can see your screen, click, and type. Keep these guidelines in mind:

- **Use synthetic or test data** when running test pilots. Don't expose real user data, credentials, or PII to the testing environment.
- **Run in a non-production environment.** Use simulators, dev servers, or staging builds — not production systems with live data.
- **Cowork is a research preview** (macOS only as of March 2026). Anthropic recommends dedicated low-privilege environments for computer use, human confirmation for consequential actions, and avoiding sensitive data on screen during sessions.
- **Review screenshots.** Test pilot sessions capture screenshots in `AUDIT_SCREENSHOTS/`. Review these before sharing or committing to ensure no sensitive data was captured.

---

## Contributing

This is experimental. We're looking for:

- **Real test reports** — run the framework, share your results
- **Domain persona packs** — healthcare, fintech, education, gaming
- **Archetype expansions** — new archetypes beyond Creator/Admin/Consumer
- **Integration guides** — how to use this with Cursor, Windsurf, and other coding agents
- **Bug reports** — inconsistencies, broken cross-references, unclear instructions

## License

MIT — use it, fork it, improve it, ship better software.
